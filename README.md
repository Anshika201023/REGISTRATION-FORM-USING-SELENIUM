# REGISTRATION-FORM-USING-SELENIUM
Making Registration Form using HTML, CSS and JavaScript alongwith automatic testing software Selenium.

This project is a web-based Registration System developed using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, along with Selenium WebDriver (Java) for automated testing.
It validates user input, provides real-time feedback, displays missing-field summaries, and ensures successful registration only when all conditions are met.

**Tech Stack**
Frontend:
1. HTML5 – Structure of the registration form
2. CSS3 – Modern, aesthetic UI design
3. JavaScript – Client-side validation and dynamic behavior
Automation & Testing
1. Java
2. Selenium WebDriver
3. ChromeDriver

Features Implemented:

Registration Form Features-

1.Required fields validation (Name, Email, Phone, Gender, Password)

2. Gender dropdown (Male / Female / Other)

3. Multiple countries support

4. Automatic country code update for phone number

5. User can type State and City

6. Password strength indicator (Weak / Medium / Strong) with color coding

7. Disposable email blocking

8. Terms & Conditions acceptance check

What Selenium Does in This Project-

Selenium WebDriver automates browser actions to:

1. Open the registration form

2. Perform negative test case (missing fields)

3. Perform positive test case (valid input)

4. Capture screenshots at each stage

5. Verify correct form behavior

Automated Test Cases:

1. Negative Test

Leaves mandatory fields empty

Submits the form

Captures validation screenshot

2. Positive Test

Fills all required fields

Submits form successfully

Captures success screenshot


This project demonstrates a complete end-to-end registration system with real-world validations and automated testing. It ensures usability, correctness, and reliability through both frontend logic and Selenium automation.
